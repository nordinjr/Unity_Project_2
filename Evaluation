# Unity Project 2 By Jake Nordin and Trey Hoopchuk

# For our game, you play as a snail far from its home! It is your goal to survive and find the way home. This is done by avoiding Salt.
# You can also destroy the salt containers by throwing your spears at them! The salt has quite a bit of health, but they can be destroyed!
# We want the player to have fun, but there may or may not be some tricky tricks througout the map!
